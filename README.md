I am a creative technologist and new media artist currently based in Pittsburgh, PA. I was recently awarded my Bachelor’s of Computer Science and Arts from Carnegie Mellon University and I am currently working as a creative technology intern at Deeplocal. I will be beginning my Master’s in Design Studies in the Mediums domain at the Harvard Graduate School of Design this Fall of 2025.

I believe that data invisible to our eyes underlie the world and through thoughtful measurement and beautiful representation we can bring these invisible patterns to light. My work focuses on building a relationship with these data. Please enjoy exploring my website!
