Hi, I'm Marc Dunand, I am currently a sophomore studying at the intersection of Computer Science and Art at Carnegie Mellon University.

I'm currently interested in learning how to simulate the physical world using cellular automota and exploring how topography determines historical events using
machine learning. I am also interested in deepening my understanding of how to use languages with a low level of abstraction to create high efficiency code.

I am currently deepening my understanding of SML(nj) and exploring how computation can be used to rigorously prove mathematics

My current projects include creating my own website, centralizing all of my past code here, and generating some of the macroscopic physical laws using a hihgly
minimal set of rules.

Please feel free to contact me at mdunand@andrew.cmu.edu!
