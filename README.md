I am an undergraduate Senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying both Computer Science and Art. I will complete my degree in May of 2025. I have experience ranging from the fully computational to the fully artistic with a special focus on interdisciplinary projects that make use of all facets of my education. I believe that data invisible to our eyes underly the world and through thoughtful measurement and beautiful representation we can bring these invisible patterns to light. My work focuses on building a relationship with these data. Please enjoy exploring my website!

A bit about me – I am originally from Chicago but I have fallen for Pittsburgh during my time here. I have two cats – Salt and Pepper whom I love dearly. Some of my hobbies include woodworking and running. I’m also a fan of tennis!
